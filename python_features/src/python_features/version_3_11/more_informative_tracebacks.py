# MORE INFORMATIVE ERROR TRACEBACKS
# ==================================

# In Python 3.10, Python’s error messages were greatly improved. Similarly, one of Python 3.11’s most anticipated
# features will also boost your developer experience. Decorative annotations are added to the tracebacks and can help
# you more quickly interpret an error message.

# hese tracebacks make debugging in Python 3.11 easier than in earlier versions. You can see more examples,
# more information about how the tracebacks are implemented, and other tools you can use in your debugging in
# the Python 3.11 preview tutorial Even Better Error Messages. For more technical details,
# have a look at PEP 657.
